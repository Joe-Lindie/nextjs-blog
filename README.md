This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).



Questions: 

1. _app.js file - how does this apply global styles to every page?
2. How is this App component working? (in _app.js)
3. In "[id].js" file, the getStaticPaths() component contains an array of known paths returned by getAllPostIds(). I cannot log the array. 
4. From the CSS section onwards, it got a tricky!
